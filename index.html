        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>My name is Emily Grover. I am from Lehi, UT. I am the oldest of 10 children. I can remember working with my dad on computers from a very young age, and that is where my interest in programming began. Aside from enjoying coding and programming, I also love digital animation. My goal is to one day work as an animator at Pixar.</p>
